`$ carto-cli`
=========================

## TO-DO

* Finish visualization and named maps interactions
* Set up defaults system for formats and a default account
* Add subcommands to `carto_env` to add, update and remove entries
* Support new `COPY` methods
* Support Auth API #3

## TL;DR

A simple set of command line applications to interact with your own CARTO account.


* [`carto_env`](#carto_env): load your credentials to interact with your account
* [`carto_sql`](#carto_sql): perform queries against the [SQL API](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api/)
* [`carto_batch`](#carto_batch): perform queries using the [Batch SQL API](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api/batch-queries)
* [`carto_dataset`](#carto_dataset): manage your CARTO datasets
* [`carto_map`](#carto_map): TO DO

## How-to's

### How to install

The package is available at [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/carto-cli/) so you can just run:

```
$ pip install carto-cli
```

### How to contribute

You can fork the repo and set up your environment for development running `pip install --editable .`

From there you can make Pull Requests with any fix or improvement. When this is more mature I'll document how to contribute a new subcommand but you can actually take a look to the `setup.py` file and then any of the scripts of the different folders.

### A note about environment variables

All the tools here use by default some environment variables. If you only manage one single CARTO account then you can set them in any initialization script that your environment uses like `~/.bashrc` or `/etc/environment` with these variables:

 - `CARTO_USER`: you user name
 - `CARTO_ORG`: the name of your CARTO organization if you use the Open Source or an Enterprise account
 - `CARTO_API_KEY`: your API key to interact with CARTO Engine
 - `CARTO_API_URL`: if you don't use a `carto.com` account you need to put here the equivalent to the API end point. For a `carto.com` account it would be `http://user.carto.com/`
 - `CARTO_CHECK_SSL`: if you are using your own server and don't have a proper certificate installed set this variable to `false`

Setting up those variables will save you having to put them on any call to the command line applications, saving you a lot of Copy&Paste work.

## `carto_env`

If you happen to work with a different set of CARTO accounts this tool is for you. This relies in a yaml file that with a very simple structure. This command wil load information into your terminal so you can copy & paste once and export your environment variables for your session or if you have the `$CARTO_ENV` environment or use the `-o` parameter it will save it in a file so you can source it.

```
$ carto_env -h
Usage: carto_env [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Allows you to get the account details

Options:
  -c, --config-file FILENAME  Configuration file to read, defaults to
                              ~/.cartorc.yaml or the environment variable
                              $CARTO_DB
  -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  list     List your stored users
  load     The user wou want to retrieve
  search   Returns the user names that match the given...
  version  Prints the version of this application
```

So if you have the `$CARTO_ENV` environment pointing for example to `/tmp/cartoenv`, then you you can load any user of your database with:

```bash
$ carto_env load jsanz
$ source /tmp/cartoenv; echo $CARTO_API_URL
```

### Configuration file

Store a `yaml` file named (by default) `~/.cartorc.yaml` with this structure

```yaml
---
jsanz:
  api_key: your_api_key
  organization: team

random_key:
  user: your_user
  api_key: another_api_key
  organization: team

onprem_user:
  api_key: your_api_key
  organization: myorg
  url: http://myserver.mydomain.com/user/username
```

By default the key will be your account name but you can specify a `user` key to have a different name for your configuration entry.

**Note**: Remember also that CARTO On-Premises instances are usually configured as domainless set ups so the username must be specificied in the url as in the last example above, where `url` is set up to `https://onprem-host/user/username`.

## `carto_sql`
